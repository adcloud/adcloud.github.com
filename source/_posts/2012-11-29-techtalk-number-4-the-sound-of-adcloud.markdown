*Winter is coming* and so is our last Tech Talk of the year. This time it is all about music and processing real time events.

The Sound of Adcloud
---

We have created an automated Adcloud music generator. The events (eg
clicks, conversions, retargeting) of our adservers are used to create
sound in real-time. Timo is going to introduce the different
components and literally going to rock the house. [Here is an
apetitzer.](http://soundcloud.com/teemow/adcloud-music)

The event will be on Wednesday, 12th of December in our office: [Venloer
Str. 25-27, Cologne](http://maps.google.de/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=de&geocode=&q=Adcloud+GmbH,+K%C3%B6ln&aq=t&sll=51.151786,10.415039&sspn=18.676297,42.407227&ie=UTF8&hq=Adcloud+GmbH,&hnear=K%C3%B6ln,+Nordrhein-Westfalen&t=h&ll=50.941826,6.936321&spn=0.03656,0.082827&z=14&layer=c&cbll=50.941682,6.936591&panoid=V7fZsdjW52tul8e5aBKh6g&cbp=12,288.94,,0,-8.03).
