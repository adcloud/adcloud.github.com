## What you will learn

This will be a very pragmatic — hands on — workshop.
We will start with a short introduction (~30 minutes) to syntax and basic usage patterns, giving you the chance to ask questions.

After that, we will encourage people to pair up and start working on our [example project](https://github.com/adcloud/clojure-intro-workshop).

In the last 30 minutes, you will be encouraged to present your solution.

We will finish with a BBQ, where you can talk with other attendees or continue on your project.

Although the event is free we ask you to register since space is limitted:

## What you will NOT learn

Given the limited amount of time and zero-prior-knowledge assumption, we can't explain philosophies, concepts and inner workings.
After the workshop, you will be able to write code in Clojure, but still lack a deeper understanding.

## Please come prepared

Please make sure that you have the [basic project](https://github.com/adcloud/clojure-intro-workshop) forked and checked out on your machine.
([The README](https://github.com/adcloud/clojure-intro-workshop#readme) has more details.)


## About Clojure

<blockquote>
<p>
Clojure is a <strong>dynamic programming language</strong> that <strong>targets the Java Virtual Machine</strong> (and the CLR, and JavaScript). It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for <strong>multithreaded programming</strong>. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides <strong>easy access to the Java frameworks</strong>, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.
</p>

<p>
Clojure is a dialect of <strong>Lisp</strong>, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a <strong>powerful macro system</strong>. Clojure is predominantly a <strong>functional</strong> programming language, and features a rich set of <strong>immutable, persistent data structures</strong>. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a <strong>software transactional memory system</strong> and <strong>reactive Agent system</strong> that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.
