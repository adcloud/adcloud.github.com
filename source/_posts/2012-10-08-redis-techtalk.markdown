The summer is over. Our little break too. Lets continoue with our
Adcloud Techtalks. This time with some with a slighlty deeper topic:

As you might have seen in [NoSQL: Not Only a Fairy
Tale](http://dev.adcloud.com/blog/2012/07/13/nosql-not-only-a-fairy-tale/)
[Redis](http://redis.io/) is one our most important NoSQL databases.
We use it extensively throughout our different systems. Time to look
behind the curtain:

Redis Internals

This time [Tim Becker](https://twitter.com/a2800276) will show us how
to pay more attention to the man behind the curtain! Redis is not
magic, in this talk we'll rummage through source code, start reading
C, examine the redis protocol, event loop and some datastructures. It
should provide enough information that you won't fear diving in the
code yourself and have a good overview of what's going on behind the
curtain.

The event will be on Wednesday, 24th October in our office: [Venloer
Str. 25-27, Cologne](http://maps.google.de/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=de&geocode=&q=Adcloud+GmbH,+K%C3%B6ln&aq=t&sll=51.151786,10.415039&sspn=18.676297,42.407227&ie=UTF8&hq=Adcloud+GmbH,&hnear=K%C3%B6ln,+Nordrhein-Westfalen&t=h&ll=50.941826,6.936321&spn=0.03656,0.082827&z=14&layer=c&cbll=50.941682,6.936591&panoid=V7fZsdjW52tul8e5aBKh6g&cbp=12,288.94,,0,-8.03).
