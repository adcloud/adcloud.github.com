After our successful start with our [first Adcloud TechTalk](http://img.ly/hoLs) we are proud to announce our second talk: Why the SOLID principles matter - even for JavaScript.

Even though the famous [SOLID](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod) design principles where invented in the context of more classical object-oriented languages like C++ and Java, the fundamental principles are enormously useful way beyond the concrete programming environment and by far not restricted to a concrete programming language. And having a well-structured code base is one of the most important factors to keep software flexible and changeable over time.

Martin Lippert (co-founder of it-agile GmbH and now working at VMware on developer tooling for JavaScript, Spring, and Cloud Foundry, tweets [@martinlippert](https://twitter.com/#!/martinlippert)) will give an overview of the SOLID principles, explain why they are so important, talk about what happens if you ignore them, and dive into some examples for JavaScript.

The event will be on Tuesday, 22nd May in our office: [Venloer Str. 25-27, Cologne](http://maps.google.de/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=de&geocode=&q=Adcloud+GmbH,+K%C3%B6ln&aq=t&sll=51.151786,10.415039&sspn=18.676297,42.407227&ie=UTF8&hq=Adcloud+GmbH,&hnear=K%C3%B6ln,+Nordrhein-Westfalen&t=h&ll=50.941826,6.936321&spn=0.03656,0.082827&z=14&layer=c&cbll=50.941682,6.936591&panoid=V7fZsdjW52tul8e5aBKh6g&cbp=12,288.94,,0,-8.03).
