We are happy announce a new (hopefully) regular event: Adcloud TechTalks. These are informal meetings around technical challenges which we face, topics which we would like to know more about or things which we just find interesting. Speakers will range from internal developers and local friends to invited industry experts.

Our goal is to learn new things and foster the software development culture in Cologne. 

These events will take place weekdays in the late afternoon. Doors open at 17:00. The talk starts at 17:30 and we calculate around 45 minutes for the talk and approx 45 minutes of discussion. Concrete dates will be announced a couple of weeks prior to the talk in this [blog](/atom.xml) and via [@adcloud](http://twitter.com/adcloud).

All events will be open to the public, although we will require some form of registration. Stay tuned for the first event.
