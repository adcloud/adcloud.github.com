We are happy announce a new (hopefully) regular event: Adcloud TechTalks. These are informal meetings around technical challenges which we face, topics which we need to more about or things which we just find interresting. Speakers will range from internal developers, over local friends to invited industry experts.

Our goal is to learn new things and foster the software development culture in Cologne. 

These events will be weekdays in the late afternoon. Doors open at 17:00. The talk starts at 17:30 and we calculate around 45 minutes talk and 45 minutes discussions. Concrete dates will be announced a couple of weeks ahead in this [blog](/atom.xml) and via [@adcloud](http://twitter.com/adcloud).

All events will be open to the public although we will likely going to use some form of registraion. Stay tuned for the first event.
