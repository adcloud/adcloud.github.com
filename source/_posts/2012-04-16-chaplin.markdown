We are happy to announce our first public Adcloud TechTalk: 


Chaplin – JavaScript Application Architecture with Backbone.js
---

Backbone.js is a small JavaScript library which helps building JavaScript-driven web applications. It’s widely used by companies like LinkedIn, Groupon, Foursquare and 37Signals. While Backbone.js is a good starting point, it is quite limited and does not provide a top-level architecture for scalable Web applications.

[Mathias Schäfer](http://molily.de/) of [9elements](http://9elements.com) will introduce [Chaplin](https://github.com/moviepilot/chaplin), a field-tested application architecture on top of Backbone.js. Chaplin establishes conventions on how to structure an application and addresses the requirements of growing JavaScript applications. Like Backbone.js itself, Chaplin is free and open-source.


The event will be on Wednesday, 25th April in our office: [Venloer Str. 25-27, Cologne](http://maps.google.de/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=de&geocode=&q=Adcloud+GmbH,+K%C3%B6ln&aq=t&sll=51.151786,10.415039&sspn=18.676297,42.407227&ie=UTF8&hq=Adcloud+GmbH,&hnear=K%C3%B6ln,+Nordrhein-Westfalen&t=h&ll=50.941826,6.936321&spn=0.03656,0.082827&z=14&layer=c&cbll=50.941682,6.936591&panoid=V7fZsdjW52tul8e5aBKh6g&cbp=12,288.94,,0,-8.03).
