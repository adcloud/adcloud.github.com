We are constantly looking for great people (and awesome developers) to improve our team. We use modern technologies and modern methodologies:

technologies.concat(methodologies).shuffle().pick(10) = ['nodejs', 'devops', 'riak', 'ubuntu', 'rails', 'redis', 'chef', 'aws', 'coffeescript', 'scrum' ]
{% endcodeblock %}
