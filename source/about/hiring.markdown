We are constantly looking for great people (and awesome developers) to improve our team. We use modern technologies and modern methodologies:

{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
technologies.concat(methodologies).shuffle().pick(10) = ['nodejs', 'devops', 'riak', 'ubuntu', 'rails', 'redis', 'chef', 'aws', 'coffeescript', 'scrum' ]
{% endcodeblock %}

In the sense of ideal candidate we are looking for the following:

### Software Engineer:
You believe in modern software engeneering practices. You constantly write automated tests, you switch between paradigms like scripting, oo or functional programming and you like to argue about your favourite editor.

### Web Enthusiast:
You have a love and hate relation ship with the web. You might like to dive into the TCP/IP stack or optimize your favourite web stack. You participate in open source projects and have a Github account. 

###  DevOp:
You know your operating system inside out. Your OS is a Unix derivate. You like to optimize your daily tasks and set up virtual environemts. You think infrastructure as a code is the way to go.

### Agile:
You don't just want to have programming tasks. You want discuss technical and business implications. You want to improve yourself and your team continuously. You are not shy of discussing this with your colleages and your manager.

Don't be alarmed if you can't meet all our expectations. But look forward to learn them all while your with us.
